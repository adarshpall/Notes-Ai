For users of Assistive Technology, we have created the following \nAccessibility Support Document to outline some of the behaviors you may observe when completing this \ntraining. \nKeyboard Navigation Resource \n• Learners can navigate Rise 360 courses entirely with their keyboards. The Rise360 Keyboard \nNavigation Resource article explains how. And authors don’t have to do anything to enable \nkeyboard accessibility: The first section of this article describes the navigation keys and their \ngeneral behavior. The second section details specifically how to use keyboard navigation in each \nsegment of a course. And the last section explains how to enable tab-key navigation on a Mac. \nLanding Screen \n• Learners can only go through the course sequentially; this means learners need to go through \nthe course lesson-by-lesson. Therefore, on the landing screen, most of the lessons are \nunavailable except for the first lesson. The lesson name for unavailable lesson is a little verbose. \nThe unavailable lesson’s color cannot be changed to have a better contrast with the \nbackground. \n• At the beginning of the landing screen, the “View Course Details” control will visually move the \nscreen to the list of lessons. Activating this control would have no effect for screen reader \nlearners. \n• For each lesson on the landing screen, meaningful icons are available next to each lesson name \nto indicate if a lesson is text, video, or assessment. These meaningful icons could not be changed \nto have a 3:1 contrast with background. \nCourse Side Navigation (Hamburger Menu) \n• The side navigation menu on each lesson can be expanded or collapsed for learners to go back \nand forth between completed lessons. Learners must use the side navigation to navigate to the \nprevious lessons. \n• For Dragon NaturallySpeaking (Dragon) users, the side navigation menu can be activated by \nannouncing “Click Toggle Class Details”. \n• The course name control in the side navigation will bring users back to the landing page. \n• Note: The UI for the side navigation is different when it is expanded and collapsed. When the \nside navigation is expanded, the first interactive element is the course title link, which brings \nusers back to the landing page. When the side navigation is collapsed, the first interactive \nelement is the \"Home\" link. \n• For some screen reader learners, when the side navigation is collapsed, the controls in the side \nnavigation are still accessible by screen reader and other assistive technologies. \n\nNext Lesson Button \n• The “Next Lesson” button is used to provide better usability for learners when moving to the \nnext lesson. However, once activated, the “Next Lesson” button will disappear when learners \nnavigate back to the previous lesson. In this case, learners would need to use the side navigation \nto continue with the course. \n• When learners activate the “Next Lesson” control, the next lesson appears on the screen. \nHowever, for learners who cannot see the screen, it might not be clear that a new lesson has \nappeared. Screen readers would announce the Course Overview section after the “Next Lesson” \ncontrol activation. \nInteractive Markers (Labeled Graphic) \n• Learners might encounter the Interactive Markers component in a course. For learners who can \nsee the screen, this component has a background image with interactive markers on top of the \nbackground image. For learners who cannot see the screen, these interactive markers have a \nname of “Labeled graphic marker”. When learners activate these markers, a dialog will open to \nreveal additional content about a marker. \n• For some screen reader learners, activating the interactive markers will automatically move \nfocus to the first line with an announcement of \"Labeled graphic bubble\". Therefore, in \nbrowse/reading mode, users would need to use the down-arrow key to go to the second line \nand then use the up-arrow key to read the first line. (Note: The browse/reading mode lets you \nnavigate and read a web page as you would a text document.) \n• The interactive markers might not have a meaningful name. The alternative text of the \nbackground image before the interactive markers will provide learners with context of the \ninteraction. \n• For some screen reader learners, the container for the marker controls can receive keyboard \nfocus. \n• The interactive markers have repeated circle animations around them. The animations cannot \nbe paused, stopped, or hidden. \n• Some Dragon users might not be able to close the interactive markers’ dialogs using direct \ncommand. Dragon users need to say “Click plus” commands to close the dialogs. \nAccordion (Expand/Collapse) \n• The accordion component can be expanded/collapsed to reveal additional information about a \ntopic.  \n• For some screen reader learners, the accordion expand/collapse state is not communicated \nimmediately. Learners would need to use the up and down arrow keys to check the state. \nNote Block \n• A Note Block is used to visually highlight an important concept or idea for people who can see \nthe screen. \n• For some screen reader learners, the Note Block has an unlabeled icon at the beginning. The \nicon is decorative and does not have any meaning.  \n\nFlashcard Component \n• The Flashcard Component allows learners to flip the “flashcard” to learn about an idea or \nconcept. For learners who can see the screen, this component is a rectangle box with the “flip” \nindication at the bottom right corner. For learners who cannot see the screen, this component is \nindicated with “Flashcard Front” and “Flashcard Back”.  \n• Learners can interact with the Flashcard Component and can flip the flashcards. However, for \nscreen reader learners, the state information is not conveyed when the flashcards are flipped. \nScreen Reader learners can use the up and down arrow keys in reading mode to explore the \nnew content (Note: The browse/reading mode lets you navigate and read a web page as you \nwould a text document.).  \n• For some Dragon users, the “Click button” command is required to flip the cards. \nVideo   \n• Rise360 has its own video player to generate videos for lessons.  \n• Note: Virtual cursor is available in a screen reader's reading mode. The virtual cursor lets you \nnavigate and read a web page as you would a text document. \n• To effectively use the “Playback rate” control, learners using screen readers can follow these \ninstructions: \no If the virtual cursor is on, activating the \"Playback rate\" control does not expand the \nmenu. Activating the “Playback rate” control automatically moves the playback rate to \nthe next level instead. For example, when users activate the “Playback rate” control \nwhen it’s at 1.0 speed, the “Playback rate” control will be move to 1.25 speed. Once \nlearners are on “2x” playback rate, the next “Click Playback Rate” activation will set the \nplayback rate to the slowest value. \no If the virtual cursor is off, the users can navigate the “Playback rate” menu grouping by \nusing the up and down arrow keys to go through the items. \n• Dragon learners can follow these instructions to use the different video player controls: \no To change the playback rate, say “Click Playback Rate”. Each time users say “Click \nPlayback Rate”, the playback rate will go up one level. Once users are on “2x” playback \nrate, the next “Click Playback Rate” will set the playback rate to the slowest value. \no To go into picture-in-picture mode, say “Click picture in picture”. To exit picture-in-\npicture mode, say “Click picture in picture” again. \no To go into full screen, say “Click Fullscreen”. To exit full screen mode, say “Click non-\nfullscreen”. \no To change the volume, get the focus to be on the Mute/Unmute control. Say “Tab” to \nmove into the volume control. Say “Go Up” to increase the volume and “Go Down” to \ndecrease the volume. \nLink Color \n• On hover, link elements within a course do not have sufficient contrast. \nTable \n• Row headers for tables are not structured as table headers. Learners would have to use the up, \ndown, left, right arrow keys to explore the table and find the row table headers. \n\nZoomable Image \n• Some images throughout a course are available to be zoomed in/out. For Dragon learners, \nzoomable image can be activated by saying “Click Zoom image”. To un-zoom the image, learners \ncan say “Click Zoom image” again or “Click Unzoom image”. \nKnowledge Checks and Final Assessment   \n• Knowledge Checks are scattered throughout a course to check learners’ understanding of a \nspecific lesson content as learners progress. Knowledge Checks are preceded by a “Knowledge \nCheck” heading. Final Assessment is at the end of a course. Final Assessment questions are \naimed to gauge learners’ understanding of the entire course content. Knowledge Checks and \nFinal Assessment questions take the form of Multiple Choice (where learners can only select one \nresponse) or Multiple Response (where learners can select multiple applicable responses). \n• Each Knowledge Check and Final Assessment question have a zoomable image after the \nquestion prompt that is marked as decorative. However, the “Zoom image” control is still \navailable for the decorative image and, therefore, might not have any context surrounding it. \n• For Multiple Choice question type, the options are properly grouped together and are \nassociated with the question prompt. Therefore, when users land on the Multiple Choice option, \nthe screen reader would announce the question prompt. However, for the Multiple Response \nquestion type, the options do not have proper grouping and are not associated with the \nquestion prompt. Therefore, learners using screen readers would have to use the up and down \narrow keys in reading mode to find the question prompt (Note: The browse/reading mode lets \nyou navigate and read a web page as you would a text document.). \n• For Dragon learners, the Multiple Choice’s radio buttons respond by accessible name but not by \ntype. \n• When learners choose a response and activate the Submit button, feedback appears after the \noptions to indicate whether the learners’ response is correct or not. The “check” and “cross” \nicons above the Knowledge Check’s feedback are decorative icons. Learners with screen readers \nmight be able to access them, but they are decorative and do not add any additional meaning.  \n• When learners activate the “Submit” button after selecting an incorrect choice, learners can \ncheck which choice is correct and incorrect by using the up and down arrow keys in reading \nmode to explore the choices again (Note: The browse/reading mode lets you navigate and read \na web page as you would a text document.). \n "
